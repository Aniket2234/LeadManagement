> *Build a Lead Management System using TypeScript, Express.js, and MongoDB with a modern interactive dashboard.*
>
> ## Requirements
>
> ### 1. Authentication
>
> * User registration and login with JWT-based authentication.
> * Basic user model with fields: name, email, password, createdAt.
>
> ### 2. Lead Management
>

>   * status (enum: "New", "Contacted", "Qualified", "Converted", "Lost")
>   * tags (array of strings)
>   * notes (array of note objects with text + timestamp)
>   * createdAt and updatedAt timestamps.
>
> ### 3. Lead Interaction Tracking
>
> * Add notes/comments for each lead.
> * Store activity log for each lead (actions: created, updated, status changed, note added).
>
> ### 4. Pipeline & Stages
>
> * Leads should move through stages: *New â†’ Contacted â†’ Qualified â†’ Converted â†’ Lost.*
> * API to update lead status.
>
> ### 5. Search & Filters
>
> * Search leads by name, email, or phone.
> * Filter by status, source, createdAt range.
>
> ### 6. Notifications & Reminders (Basic)
>
> * Users can set *follow-up reminders* for a lead with a date and message.
> * API to fetch todayâ€™s reminders.
>
> ### 7. Dashboard (Interactive Analytics)
>
> Build a *responsive, modern, and creative dashboard* that displays insights with *interactive charts and graphs.*
>
> * *Summary Metrics (Top Cards)*
>
>   * Total leads
>   * New leads today
>   * Leads converted this week
>   * Leads lost this month
> * *Charts & Visualizations*
>
>   * ðŸ“Š *Leads by Status* (Pie/Donut chart showing New, Contacted, Qualified, Converted, Lost).
>   * ðŸ“ˆ *Leads Created Over Time* (Line/Bar chart with daily, weekly, monthly filters).
>   * ðŸ“Š *Leads by Source* (Bar chart or pie chart: Website, Referral, Ad, Other).
>   * ðŸ“ˆ *Conversion Trend* (Monthly conversion rate %).
>   * ðŸ“… *Daily/Weekly/Monthly reports* toggle.
> * *Reminders & Upcoming Tasks Widget*
>
>   * Show todayâ€™s follow-ups.
>   * Show overdue reminders.
> * *Recent Activity Feed*
>

> * *Export & Reports*
>
>   * API to export leads and analytics as CSV/Excel.
>   * Option to download monthly summary report.
>
> ### 8. Development Guidelines
>
> * Use *Express.js with TypeScript* (routes, controllers, services, models).
> * Use *Mongoose* for MongoDB schema.
> * Apply *JWT middleware* for protected routes.
> * Provide *REST APIs* for all features.
> * Maintain *clean folder structure*:
